# BFE — Progress Log

Running engineering log for BFE (`com.the412banner.bfe`). Newest state first, then the timeline, then
lessons and backlog. Companion to the README (what the app *does*) — this is *how it got here and
where it stands*.

---

## Current state (2026-10-13)

- **Latest release: v1.0 (versionCode 12), the first stable release.** https://github.com/The412Banner/BFE/releases/tag/v1.0
  Cut by `release.yml`; see the timeline for commits and CI runs.
- **1.0 adds:** in-app updater (update.json on the `manifest` branch, fallback
  `releases/latest/download/update.json`; versionCode compare; Update / Later / Skip; cancelable
  download; SHA-256 check; installer via FileProvider; install-unknown-apps flow; 6 h auto-check
  toggle), `release.yml`, BFE's own **Open with** sheet on file tap (built-in actions + apps + Open as
  chips + per-extension default), grouped ⋮ menu, long-press = multi-select, folder item counts + medium
  dates in List/Compact, clickable breadcrumb, drag-to-resize panes, snackbars, empty/error/no-match
  states, Settings + About (theme mode, dynamic color, default apps, licenses in-app), full Material 3
  colour scheme with themed system bars, monochrome launcher icon, byte sizes without decimals.
- **Signing:** one key since 0.1 (`CN=BFE Test`, cert SHA-256 `4693b885…08fe`). CI now reads it from
  the `BFE_KEYSTORE_B64` secret (same key) with the committed file as fallback, and
  `scripts/check-signing.sh` fails any build signed with a different certificate.
- **Verification level:** 1.0 is CI-built, certificate-checked and version-checked; nothing in 1.0 has
  been run on a device by the maintainer yet. The updater's download + install path can only be
  exercised once a release newer than 1.0 exists. The older device-test backlog (SAF/root, compression,
  cloner, converter, toolbar) still stands.

## In flight: Home dashboard (`feat/home-dashboard`, 2026-10-16)
Owner ask (File Manager+ home grid as reference): the first screen shows the same options plus cloud
management. Branch off `main` `ca38ed6` (1.0.1); not merged, no release.
- **What:** BFE now opens on a Home grid (4 cols portrait, 5-10 landscape) of tiles with live stats:
  Main storage (StorageStatsManager total/free = Settings' numbers, decimal units, usage bar), one tile
  per removable volume (StorageRoots + StatFs), System (`/` via RootBackend when root is granted or
  granted on tap, else File read-only), Downloads (walkFileTree: size + top-level item count), Images /
  Audio / Videos / Documents / New files (MediaStore "external" = all volumes; size + count), Apps,
  Cloud / Remote / Access from network (placeholders), then a Favorites row. ⋮ = Refresh, Settings,
  Check for updates, About.
- **Category browser** (`ui/screens/categories/`): MediaStore list → list/grid (Coil for images,
  `loadThumbnail` for video/audio), sort name/size/date, search, multi-select Share / Copy to… / Move
  to… (BFE's own folder picker = FileManagerScreen pick-dir mode, so Download/ and roots are pickable)
  / Delete (+ MediaScanner rescan); tap = Open with sheet with Show in folder / Install / Extract to….
- **Apps** (`ui/screens/apps/`): PackageManager list, User/System/All, search, sort; sizes via
  StorageStatsManager (Usage access) or one root `du` pass, else APK size + grant banner; sheet with
  Open, App info, Uninstall, Back up APK (`<label>_<version>.apk`, split → `.apks` zip of base+splits,
  default `Download/BFE Backups`, folder choosable), Share APK (named copy in cache), Clone… (the
  existing ApkEditorDialog + ApkJobService, output in the backup folder), Browse app data (root).
- **Navigation:** `AppRoute` in MainActivity's AppRoot. FileManagerScreen stays composed under every
  other screen (panes keep folder, selection, clipboard); while hidden its BackHandlers are pointed at a
  detached OnBackPressedDispatcher (`BackScope`) so Back on Home exits instead of climbing an invisible
  pane. FileManagerScreen got 3 optional params (`openRequest`, `onHome`, `onBackAtRoot`), a toolbar
  Home button, a Back-at-root handler and a last-folder pref write — nothing else in it changed.
- **Settings → Start on:** Home (default) / Last folder (active pane's File path, saved on navigation).
- **Intent:** `MainActivity.EXTRA_OPEN_PATH` (String, absolute folder path) skips Home and opens the
  file manager there (onCreate + onNewIntent); for the extraction notification's "Open folder".
- **Permissions:** `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` (lists BFE under Usage access; user-granted) and
  `REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES` (required at targetSdk 28 to hand a package to the uninstall dialog).
- **Verification:** CI compile only (no device run, no JVM tests). `build.yml` on the branch:
  run 38977484101 green on `8eab222` (feature); follow-up fixes (backup dialog steps aside for its
  folder picker; comparator) re-built on the next commit.
- **Owner to confirm:** decimal units on the storage tiles only (matches Settings / the box; file
  sizes elsewhere stay binary); the Cloud / Remote / Network stats lines ("Cloud storage",
  "SFTP · SMB · WebDAV", "HTTP · FTP"); Documents + New files skip dot-folders; New files = last 7 days
  by date added; copies in the category browser never overwrite (" (1)"); clones from Apps land in the
  backup folder; Back at a storage root goes Home (also after "Show in folder").

## Release pipeline (how every version is cut)
**From 1.0:** `gh workflow run release.yml -f version=X.Y -f release_notes="..."` does steps 1-3 below
in one job (version bump/validation, build, certificate + aapt check, release `vX.Y` with
`BFE-X.Y.apk` + `update.json`, manifest branch). The notes are user-facing (shown in the update
dialog), never a placeholder; the workflow rejects obvious ones. Push docs first so the tag lands on
the final commit. Then verify both update.json URLs, the asset's version + certificate, and stage.

Before 1.0 (manual):
1. Feature work on `main` (agent-built), pushed → `build.yml` runs `assembleRelease` (signed with the
   test key, v1+v2+v3) → artifact `bfe-release-apk`.
2. Verify: `gh run view <id> --json conclusion,jobs` (never trust `gh run watch`), download the
   artifact, `aapt dump badging` (package/versionCode/versionName/ABI), and
   **`apksigner verify --min-sdk-version 21 -v`** — the `--min-sdk-version 21` is required to make
   apksigner *report* v1; at the APK's real minSdk 26 it prints `v1: false` even though the v1
   signature is present and valid.
3. Cut a GitHub Release `vX.Y` **targeting the full 40-char build SHA** (a short SHA fails with
   "target_commitish is invalid"), attach `BFE-X.Y.apk`, notes list the APK SHA-256.
4. Stage to the maintainer's device: `cp` to `/sdcard/Download/BFE-X.Y.apk`, checksum-match.
5. Ping.

## Design decisions (owner, 2026-10-13)
Made from the owner's screenshots during the 1.0 round. Keep these when changing the browser UI:
- **Rows use the free space:** folders show "N items" and the last-modified date, files show size
  and date. Counts are computed lazily per visible row, off the main thread. Byte sizes have no decimals ("34 B").
- **Tapping a file opens BFE's own Open with sheet, never Android's chooser.** BFE's actions are at
  the top (extract, install, clone, convert, properties) and installed apps that can open it are
  below, with "Open as" type chips. A remembered "Always use for .ext" app is listed first and
  marked, but is **never launched automatically**; every tap shows the sheet.
- **Tapping a file does not open the ⋮ action menu.** This was tried and rejected; the ⋮ button keeps the menu.
- Tapping a folder navigates; long-press starts multi-select; the ⋮ menu is grouped, with Delete in the error color.

## Architecture (where things live)
```
app/src/main/java/com/the412banner/bfe/
├─ unpack/     SevenZip / Innoextract / Unarc wrappers · UnpackService (extract job, baselined dest poller) · FastExtract
├─ pack/       PackModels (incl. .wcp profile.json) · SevenZipPack · TarZstPack · PackService (compress job)
├─ storage/    StorageBackend (Loc = FileLoc|SafLoc|RootLoc) · RootBackend (libsu, fixOwnership) · StorageTransfer · AppStorage (pins)
├─ apk/        ApkRewriter (ARSCLib rename+fixups) · ApkSigning (apksig, zipalign) · SigningKeys · ApkJobService · ApkModels
├─ video/      Ffmpeg (exec libffmpeg.so, -progress parsing) · ConvertService · ConvertModels
├─ ui/screens/ FileManagerScreen (PaneState, BrowserPane, SharedToolbar, dual-pane) · UnpackArchiveScreen · CompressDialog · ConvertDialog · ApkToolsDialogs
└─ ui/         UnpackProgressPill (+ pack/convert pills) · theme · CollapsibleRail
app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/  lib7zz · libinnoextract (+boost/lzma/iconv/z/bz2 closure) · libunarc · libc++_shared · libffmpeg
.github/workflows/  build.yml (signed release APK, gradle caching) · build-ffmpeg.yml (static NDK ffmpeg+x264)
```
Native engines are **exec'd** from `nativeLibraryDir` (not `System.loadLibrary`), which is why
`android:extractNativeLibs="true"` is mandatory.

## Lessons learned (don't repeat these)
- **A `/*` inside a Kotlin block comment cannot be escaped** — the glob `lib/**\/*.so` in a KDoc opened
  nested comments that swallowed the rest of two files, producing a cascade of bogus "unresolved
  reference" errors. Diagnose "Unclosed comment" *first*; check `/\*` vs `\*/` balance per file.
- Material3 `SegmentedButton` / `ExposedDropdownMenu` / `PullToRefresh` need `@OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3Api)`;
  a refactor can silently drop a function-level opt-in — prefer file-level.
- `apksigner verify` reports `v1: false` at minSdk ≥ 24 even when v1 is present/valid — use
  `--min-sdk-version 21` to see the truth.
- `gh release create --target` needs the **full** SHA.
- The dest-size progress pollers (innoextract/FreeArc) must **baseline** the destination; summing
  everything already there pins the bar at 100% on a re-extract. (Bannerlator still has this bug.)
- The bundled 7-Zip 24.08 is **zstd decode-only** (`-tzstd` → E_NOTIMPL) — tzst/.wcp creation uses
  commons-compress tar + zstd-jni.
- Build agents can die from a mid-session model switch (transcript lost) or a network drop (API
  connection lost) — resume via the agent id when it exists, else respawn with the file-map brief
  above. Work on disk is never lost.
- `android-actions/setup-android@v3` installs the retired `tools` package by default, which current
  sdkmanager rejects ("Failed to find package 'tools'"). Pass `packages: 'platform-tools'`.
- A Compose gesture *extension* (`detectTapGestures`) can't be called by its fully qualified name;
  import it.
- The updater depends on signature continuity: CI checks the certificate digest on every build so a
  wrong key can never reach a release.
- The build agent and coordinator share one checkout: always check `git rev-list origin/main..HEAD`
  before pushing docs so you don't ship half-done work early.

## Known limitations (as of 1.0)
SAF only reaches DocumentsProvider apps; extracting
*from* a SAF/root-hosted archive unsupported; piped tar.gz/xz report % not per-file; Compact ≈2× (not
¼) density; `.bk2` (Bink 2) undecodable; software-only x264; MP4-only output; clones of
signature-checking / Play-licensed / Google-services apps may not run; no
predictive-back animation (targetSdk 28); imported keystore passwords stored in private prefs as
plain text.

## Backlog / next
- **Device-test pass** (the real gate): SAF pin + browse; root pin, copy *into* an emulator app's
  sandbox and confirm the app still reads it; Create WCP from a DXVK folder and install it in
  Bannerlator; Clone & Install a simple app, then an installed split app; convert a `.bik`/`.wmv`
  cutscene; confirm the 0.9 toolbar on a narrow phone; re-extract over an existing folder for 0.9.1.
- **Port back into Bannerlator** — assessed 2026-09-02 as feasible: `storage/`, `pack/`, `apk/`,
  `video/`, the progress-fix, APK icons, New file, intent filters all drop in nearly as-is (Bannerlator
  has most deps); the real work is merging the dual-pane/shared-toolbar `FileManagerScreen` refactor
  back **while keeping** Bannerlator's container/Wine/shortcut hooks. Do it in phases, on a feature
  branch, behind device tests, under the vc-77 freeze. First and cheapest: the 0.9.1 progress-bar fix.
- **First updater proof:** with 1.0 installed from the release, cut the next release (e.g. 1.0.1) and
  confirm 1.0 offers it, downloads, verifies and installs over itself.
- Device-check the 1.0 UI: Open with sheet (chips, default app, empty state), item counts on SAF/root,
  breadcrumb, pane divider, Settings theme/dynamic color, license viewer.
- Nice-to-haves: extract-from-SAF/root archives; more converter outputs; a built-in text/image viewer
  for the Open with sheet; a private (non-public) release key, which would need key rotation (APK v3
  signing lineage) so existing installs keep updating.
